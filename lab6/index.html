		<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
		<h1>Challenge</h1>
			<p>The challenge of this lab was to use JavaScript objects and arrays in a code.</p>
		<h1>Problems</h1>
			<p>originally defining an array was very difficult. We were unsure how to exactly name the array and state that it is an array. We realized that because java script is a higher level language we only needed to define the name and the language automatically figures out that it is an array </p>
		<h1>Results</h1>
			<p>The html file is created here, and you can look at the program execution below:</p>

	<div id = "script">
		<h2>Script Output</h2>
		<script src="js/lab.js"></script>
