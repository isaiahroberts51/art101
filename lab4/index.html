	<h1>Challenge</h1>
		<p>Breaking down an everyday task into main steps and sub-steps was surprisingly difficult. There are a lot of details in these tasks that this process of pseudocoding exposed</p>
	<h1>Problems</h1>
		<p>One problem that we encountered was the authorblock in the javascript file. Since neither me or my partner had used author blocks before, we were unsure how the formatting of one was supposed to look.</p>
	<h1>Results</h1>
		<p>This pseudo code outlines the basics steps to checking your car's oil level:</p>
		<div id="code">
		<pre><code>
		//Checking your car’s oil level:
		//Find a safe place like a gas station or your driveway
		//Turn off your car
		//Pop the hood
		//Remove the dipstick
		//Check the oil level on the dipstick
		//Determine whether to add oil or not based on the level
		  //Add oil if low
		  //Do not add oil if full
		//Put the dipstick back in place whether you added oil or not
		</pre></code>

		<p>This code shows how a computer task of a Connect 4 game would be created:</p>
		<pre><code>
		//Creating a Connect 4 game:
		//Show the current board
		//Player inputs their move
		//Make sure their move is valid (Column isn’t full)
		//See if player wins
		//Computer inputs their move
		//Make sure their move is valid
		//See if computer wins
		</pre></code>
		</div>
