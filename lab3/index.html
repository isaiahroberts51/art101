	<h1> Lab 3 File Structure and File Transfer </h1>
	<p> In this lab, our goal is to create a local file structure and add index.html files. </p>
	<h2> Challenges </h2>
	<p> One challenge that I faced was with resizing my image to fit the screen, because I didn't realize you had to save the .css file and the index file separately and that the entire file structure didn't save together. </p>
	<h2> Results </h2>
	<p> The local file structure that I made can be seen below. </p>
