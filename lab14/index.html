        <h1>Challenge</h1>
          <p>The challenge of this lab is to look over previous labs and correct any errors.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="problems">
        <h1>Problems</h1>
          <p>We had no issues with previous labs.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="results">
        <h1>Results</h1>
          <p>We do not have any results because we did not have any labs to correct.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Debugging:</h2>
        <div id="debugging">
          <p>We debugged our previous labs by looking in the console. We saw no errors when doing this. Because of this we tried to expose bugs in our previous labs by doing things like pressing buttons repeatedly and entering strange characters. We also found no issues when doing this. </p>
