        <h1>Challenge</h1>
          <p>The challenge of this lab was to begin to understand how to use the jQuery JavaScript library. We already knew how to perform all of the tasks in this lab with conventional Javascript. The challenge was transferring this knowledge over to jQuery.</p>

        <h1>Problems</h1>
          <p>Most of the problems came when we had to implement buttons since we hadn't done so in this fashion before. Creating the button element with jQuery and then creating an event listener for that button was especially difficult.</p>

        <h1>Results</h1>
          <p>The results can be seen by clicking one of the buttons labeled "Make me special"</p>
