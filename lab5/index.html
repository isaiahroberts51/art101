    <h1>Challenge</h1>
        <p>The challenge was to experiment with JavaScript by using different data types and variables.</p>
    <h1>Problems</h1>
        <p>One problem that we had was when making the JavaScript file, for the variables we put var in front of each variable before defining it, although we didn't need to.</p>
    <h1>Results</h1>
        <p>This is the html file created, and below you can see the script output for the program.</p>
        <div id= "image">
            <img src="img/image.png"width=650 align="left">
        </div>
        <div id="output">
                    <h2>Script Output</h2>
                <div class=output>
             <script type="text/javascript" src="js/lab.js"></script>
